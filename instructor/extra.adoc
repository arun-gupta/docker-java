# Environment maintenance

This are some instructions to keep the instructor environment


## Uptating the attendees instructions served by the instructor httpd server

The instructor webserver [http://localhost:8082/] provides the link:https://github.com/javaee-samples/docker-java/blob/master/docker-java-lab.adoc[attendes instructions] in the HTML format.

To update the HTML, have http://asciidoctor.org/ installed and run the following command:

[source, text]
----
asciidoctor ../docker-java-lab.adoc -a data-uri -a numbered -a experimental -a source-highlighter=coderay -a imagesdir=images -o instructor/dockerfiles/lab-httpd-server/index.html
----

After that, you will need to build the services again running

[source, text]
----
docker-compose build
----


## Backing up Nexus data container to a file

If you need to update the nexusbackup.tar file, run the following command:

[source, text]
----
docker run --rm --volumes-from nexusdata -v  $(pwd):/backup ubuntu tar cvf /backup/nexusbackup.tar /sonatype-work
----

This will compress the contents of /sonatype-work folder from the nexusdata container in to a file called nexusbackup.tar
