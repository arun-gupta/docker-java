## Java EE Application on Docker Swarm Cluster

Docker Swarm is native clustering for Docker. It allows you create and access to a pool of Docker hosts using the full suite of Docker tools. Because Docker Swarm serves the standard Docker API, any tool that already communicates with a Docker daemon can use Swarm to transparently scale to multiple hosts

### Key Components of Docker Swarm

.Key Components of Docker Swarm
image::images/docker-swarm-components.png[]

*Swarm Manager*: Docker Swarm has a Manager, that is a pre-defined Docker Host, and is a single point for all administration. The swarm manager orchestrates and schedules containers on the entire cluster. Currently only a single instance of manager is allowed in the cluster. This is a SPOF for high availability architectures and additional managers will be allowed in a future version of Swarm with https://github.com/docker/swarm/issues/598[#598].

*Swarm Nodes*: The containers are deployed on Nodes that are additional Docker Hosts. Each Swarm Node must be accessible by the manager, each node must listen to the same network interface (TCP port). Each node runs a Docker Swarm agent that registers the referenced Docker daemon, monitors it, and updates the discovery backend with the node’s status. The containers run on a node.

*Scheduler Strategy*: Different scheduler strategies ("`binpack`", "`spread`" (default), and "`random`") can be applied to pick the best node to run your container. The default strategy optimizes the node for least number of running containers. There are multiple kinds of filters, such as constraints and affinity.  This should allow for a decent scheduling algorithm.

*Node Discovery Service*: By default, Swarm uses hosted discovery service, based on Docker Hub, using tokens to discover nodes that are part of a cluster. However etcd, consul, and ZooKeeper can be also be used for service discovery as well. This is particularly useful if there is no access to Internet, or you are running the setup in a closed network. A new discovery backend can be created as explained here. It would be useful to have the hosted Discovery Service inside the firewall and https://github.com/docker/swarm/issues/660[#660] will discuss this.

**Standard Docker API:** Docker Swarm serves the standard Docker API and thus any tool that talks to a single Docker host will seamlessly scale to multiple hosts now. That means that if you were using shell scripts using Docker CLI to configure multiple Docker hosts, the same CLI would can now talk to Swarm cluster and Docker Swarm will then act as proxy and run it on the cluster.

There are lots of other concepts but these are the main ones.

### Create a Docker Swarm Cluster

. The easiest way of using Swarm is, by using the official Docker image:

  docker run swarm create
+
This command returns a discovery token, referred as <TOKEN> in this document, and is the unique cluster id. It will be used when creating master and nodes later. This cluster id is returned by the hosted discovery service on Docker Hub.
+
It shows the output as:
+
[source, text]

----
+
The last line is the <TOKEN>.
+
NOTE: Make sure to note this cluster id now as there is no means to list it later. This should be fixed with https://github.com/docker/swarm/issues/661[#661].
+
. Swarm is fully integrated with Docker Machine, and so is the easiest way to get started. Let's create a Swarm Master next:
+
[source, text]
----
docker-machine create -d virtualbox --swarm --swarm-master --swarm-discovery token://<TOKEN> swarm-master
----
+
Replace `<TOKEN>` with the cluster id obtained in the previous step. 
+
`--swarm` configures the machine with Swarm, `--swarm-master` configures the created machine to be Swarm master. Swarm master creation talks to the hosted service on Docker Hub and informs that a master is created in the cluster.
+
. Connect to this newly created master and find some more information about it:
+
[source, text]
----
eval "$(docker-machine env swarm-master)"
docker info
----
+
NOTE: If you're on Windows, use the `docker-machine env swarm-master` command only and copy the output into an editor to replace all appearances of EXPORT with SET and issue the three commands at your command prompt, remove the quotes and all duplicate appearences of "/".
+
This will show the output as:

. Create a Swarm node

 docker-machine create -d virtualbox --swarm --swarm-discovery token://<TOKEN> swarm-node-01
+
Replace `<TOKEN>` with the cluster id obtained in an earlier step. 
+
Node creation talks to the hosted service at Docker Hub and joins the previously created cluster. This is specified by `--swarm-discovery token://...` and specifying the cluster id obtained earlier.
. To make it a real cluster, let's create a second node:

  docker-machine create -d virtualbox --swarm --swarm-discovery token://<TOKEN> swarm-node-02
+
Replace `<TOKEN>` with the cluster id obtained in the previous step. 

. List all the nodes created so far:

  docker-machine ls
+
This shows the output similar to the one below:

There is a total of 4 containers running in this cluster – one Swarm agent on master and each node, and there is an additional swarm-agent-master running on the master.

### Deploy Java EE Application to Docker Swarm Cluster

The complete cluster is in place now, and we need to deploy the Java EE application to it.

Swarm takes care for the distribution of deployments across the nodes. The only thing, we need to do is to deploy the application as already explained in <<JavaEE7_Container_Linking>>.

. Start MySQL server as:
+
[source, text]
----
docker run --name mysqldb -e MYSQL_USER=mysql -e MYSQL_PASSWORD=mysql -e MYSQL_DATABASE=sample -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=supersecret -p 3306:3306 -d mysql
----
+
`-e` define environment variables that are read by the database at startup and allow us to access the database with this user and password.
+
. Start WildFly and deploy Java EE 7 application as:
+
[source, text]
----
docker run -d --name mywildfly --link mysqldb:db -p 8080:8080 arungupta/wildfly-mysql-javaee7
----
+
This is using the https://docs.docker.com/userguide/dockerlinks/[Docker Container Linking] explained earlier.
+

### Deploy Java EE Application to Docker Swarm Cluster using Docker Compose

<<Docker_Compose>> explains how multi container applications can be easily started using Docker Compose.

. Connect to '`swarm-node-02`':

  eval "$(docker-machine env swarm-node-02)"

. Stop the MySQL and WildFly containers:

  docker ps -a | grep wildfly | awk '{print $1}' | xargs docker rm -f
  docker ps -a | grep mysql | awk '{print $1}' | xargs docker rm -f

. Use the `docker-compose.yml` file explained in <<Docker_Compose>> to start the containers as:

  docker-compose up -d
  Creating wildflymysqljavaee7_mysqldb_1...
  Creating wildflymysqljavaee7_mywildfly_1...

. Check the containers running in the cluster as:

  eval "$(docker-machine env --swarm swarm-master)"
  docker info
+
to see the output as:
