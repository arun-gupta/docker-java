## Deploy Java EE 7 Application (Pre-Built WAR)

https://github.com/javaee-samples/javaee7-hol[Java EE 7 Movieplex] is a standard multi-tier enterprise application that shows design patterns and anti-patterns for a typical Java EE 7 application.

Pull the Docker image that contains WildFly and pre-built Java EE 7 application WAR file as shown:

[source, text]
----
docker pull arungupta/javaee7-hol
----

The https://github.com/arun-gupta/docker-images/blob/master/javaee7-hol/Dockerfile[javaee7-hol Dockerfile] is based on `jboss/wildfly` and adds the movieplex7 application as war file.

Run it:

[source, text]
----
docker run -it -p 8080:8080 arungupta/javaee7-hol
----

See the application in action at http://dockerhost:8080/movieplex7/. The output is shown:

This uses an in-memory database with WildFly application server as shown in the image:

Only two changes are required to the standard `jboss/wildfly` image:

. By default, WildFly starts in Web platform. This Java EE 7 application uses some capabilities from the Full Platform and so WildFly is started in that mode instead as:
+
[source, text]
----
CMD ["/opt/jboss/wildfly/bin/standalone.sh", "-c", "standalone-full.xml", "-b", "0.0.0.0"]
----
+
. WAR file is copied to the `standalone/deployments` directory as:
+
[source, text]
----
RUN curl -L https://github.com/javaee-samples/javaee7-hol/raw/master/solution/movieplex7-1.0-SNAPSHOT.war -o /opt/jboss/wildfly/standalone/deployments/movieplex7-1.0-SNAPSHOT.war
