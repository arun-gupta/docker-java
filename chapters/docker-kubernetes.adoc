## Java EE Application on Kubernetes Cluster

[quote, github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/kubernetes/]
Kubernetes is an open source system for managing containerized applications across multiple hosts, providing basic mechanisms for deployment, maintenance, and scaling of applications.

Kubernetes, or "`k8s`" in short, allows the user to provide declarative primitives for the desired state, for example "`need 5 WildFly servers and 1 MySQL server running`". Kubernetes self-healing mechanisms, such as auto-restarting, re-scheduling, and replicating containers then ensure this state is met. The user just define the state and Kubernetes ensures that the state is met at all times on the cluster.

*How is it related to Docker?*

Docker provides the lifecycle management of containers. A Docker image defines a build time representation of the runtime containers. There are commands to start, stop, restart, link, and perform other lifecycle methods on these containers. Kubernetes uses Docker to package, instantiate, and run containerized applications.

*How does Kubernetes simplify containerized application deployment?*

A typical application would have a cluster of containers across multiple hosts. For example, your web tier (for example Undertow) might run as a few instances, and likely on a set of containers. Similarly, your application tier (for example, WildFly) would run on a different set of containers. The web tier would need to delegate the request to application tier. The web, application, and database tier would generally run on a separate set of containers. These containers would need to talk to each other. Using any of the solutions mentioned above would require scripting to start the containers, and monitoring/bouncing if something goes down. Kubernetes does all of that for the user after the application state has been defined.

### Key Components

At a very high level, there are three key components:

. *Pods* are the smallest deployable units that can be created, scheduled, and managed. Its a logical collection of containers that belong to an application.
. *Master* is the central control point that provides a unified view of the cluster. There is a single master node that control multiple minions.
. *Node* is a worker node that run tasks as delegated by the master. Minions can run one or more pods. It provides an application-specific "`virtual host`" in a containerized environment.

A picture is always worth a thousand words and so this is a high-level logical block diagram for Kubernetes:

.Kubernetes Key Components

After the 50,000 feet view, lets fly a little lower at 30,000 feet and take a look at how Kubernetes make all of this happen. There are a few key components at Master and Minion that make this happen.

. *Replication Controller* is a resource at Master that ensures that requested number of pods are running on minions at all times.
. *Service* is an object on master that provides load balancing across a replicated group of pods.
Label is an arbitrary key/value pair in a distributed watchable storage that the Replication Controller uses for service discovery.
. *Kubelet* Each minion runs services to run containers and be managed from the master. In addition to Docker, Kubelet is another key service installed there. It reads container manifests as YAML files that describes a pod. Kubelet ensures that the containers defined in the pods are started and continue running.
. Master serves *RESTful Kubernetes API* that validate and configure Pod, Service, and Replication Controller.

### Start Kubernetes Cluster

Kubernetes cluster can be easily started using Vagrant. There are two options to start the cluster - first using a downloaded Kubernetes distribution bundle and second by downloading the latest bundle as part of the install.

#### Using Previously Downloaded Kubernetes Distribution

. Setup a Kubernetes cluster as:
+
[source, text]
----
cd kubernetes

export KUBERNETES_PROVIDER=vagrant
./cluster/kube-up.sh
----
+
The `KUBERNETES_PROVIDER` environment variable tells all of the various cluster management scripts which variant to use.
+
NOTE: This will take a few minutes, so be patience! Vagrant will provision each machine in the cluster with all the necessary components to run Kubernetes.
+
It shows the output as:
+
[source, text]
----
Starting cluster using provider: vagrant
... calling verify-prereqs
... calling kube-up
Using credentials: vagrant:vagrant

. . .

Cluster validation succeeded
Done, listing cluster services:

Kubernetes master is running at https://10.245.1.2
KubeDNS is running at https://10.245.1.2/api/v1/proxy/namespaces/kube-system/services/kube-dns
KubeUI is running at https://10.245.1.2/api/v1/proxy/namespaces/kube-system/services/kube-ui
----
+
Note down the address for Kubernetes master, `https://10.245.1.2` in this case.

#### Download and Start the Cluster Together

. Alternatively, the cluster can also be started as:
+

#### Verify the Cluster

. Verify the Kubernetes cluster as:
+
[source, text]
----
kubernetes> vagrant status
Current machine states:

master                    running (virtualbox)
minion-1                  running (virtualbox)

This environment represents multiple VMs. The VMs are all listed
above with their current state. For more information about a specific
VM, run `vagrant status NAME`.
----
+
By default, the Vagrant setup will create a single kubernetes-master and 1 kubernetes-minion. Each VM will take 1 GB, so make sure you have at least 2GB to 4GB of free memory (plus appropriate free disk space).
+
NOTE: By default, only one minion is created. This can be manipulated by setting an environment variable NUM_MINIONS variable to an integer before invoking `kube-up.sh` script.
+
.Kubernetes Cluster using Vagrant
image::chapters/images/kubernetes-cluster-vagrant.png[]
+
By default, each VM in the cluster is running Fedora, Kubelet is installed into ``systemd'', and all other Kubernetes services are running as containers on Master.
+
. Access https://10.245.1.2 (or whatever IP address is assigned to your kubernetes cluster start up log). This may present the warning as shown below:
+
image::chapters/images/kubernetes-master-default-output-certificate.png[]
+
Click on '`Advanced`' and then on '`Proceed to 10.245.1.2`' to see the output as:
+
.Kubernetes Output from Master

### Deploy Java EE Application

Pods, and the IP addresses assigned to them, are ephemeral. If a pod dies then Kubernetes will recreate that pod because of its self-healing features, but it might recreate it on a different host. Even if it is on the same host, a different IP address could be assigned to it. And so any application cannot rely upon the IP address of the pod.

Kubernetes services is an abstraction which defines a logical set of pods. A service is typically back-ended by one or more physical pods (associated using labels), and it has a permanent IP address that can be used by other pods/applications. For example, WildFly pod can not directly connect to a MySQL pod but can connect to MySQL service. In essence, Kubernetes service offers clients an IP and port pair which, when accessed, redirects to the appropriate backends.

.Kubernetes Service
image::chapters/images/kubernetes-service.png[]

NOTE: In this case, all the pods are running on a single minion. This is because, that is the default number for a Kubernetes cluster. The pod can very be on another minion if more number of minions are configured to start in the cluster.

Any Service that a Pod wants to access must be created before the Pod itself, or else the environment variables will not be populated.

The order of Service and the targeted Pods does not matter. However Service needs to be started before any other Pods consuming the Service are started.

#### Start MySQL Pod

. Start MySQL Pod:
+
[source, text]
----
./cluster/kubectl.sh create -f ../../attendees/kubernetes/app-mysql-pod.yaml
pods/mysql-pod
----
+
It uses the following configuration file:
+
[source, yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: mysql-pod
  labels:
    name: mysql-pod
    context: docker-k8s-lab
spec:
  containers:
    -
      name: mysql
      image: mysql:latest
      env:
        -
          name: "MYSQL_USER"
          value: "mysql"
        -
          name: "MYSQL_PASSWORD"
          value: "mysql"
        -
          name: "MYSQL_DATABASE"
          value: "sample"
        -
          name: "MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD"
          value: "supersecret"
      ports:
        -
          containerPort: 3306
----
+
. Get status of the Pod:
+
[source, text]
----
kubernetes> ./cluster/kubectl.sh get -w po
NAME        READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
mysql-pod   0/1       Pending   0          4s
NAME        READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
mysql-pod   0/1       Running   0          44s
mysql-pod   1/1       Running   0         44s
----
+
`-w` watches for changes to the requested object. Wait for the MySQL pod to be in Running status.

#### Start MySQL service

. Start MySQL Service:
+
[source, text]
----
./cluster/kubectl.sh create -f ../../attendees/kubernetes/app-mysql-service.yaml
services/mysql-service
----
+
It uses the following configuration file:
+
[source, yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: mysql-service
  labels:
    name: mysql-pod
    context: docker-k8s-lab
spec:
  ports:
    # the port that this service should serve on
    - port: 3306
  # label keys and values that must match in order to receive traffic for this service
  selector:
    name: mysql-pod
    context: docker-k8s-lab
----
+
Once again, the "`context: docker-k8s-lab`" label is used. This simplifies querying the created pods later on.
+
. Get status of the Service:
+
[source, text]
----
./cluster/kubectl.sh get -w se
NAME            LABELS                                    SELECTOR                                IP(S)          PORT(S)
kubernetes      component=apiserver,provider=kubernetes   <none>                                  10.247.0.1     443/TCP
mysql-service   context=docker-k8s-lab,name=mysql-pod     context=docker-k8s-lab,name=mysql-pod   10.247.63.43   3306/TCP
----
+
If multiple services are running, then it can be narrowed by specifying labels:
+
[source, text]
----
./cluster/kubectl.sh  get -w po -l context=docker-k8s-lab,name=mysql-pod
NAME        READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
mysql-pod   1/1       Running   0          4m
----
+
This is also the selector label used by Service to target Pods.
+
When a Service is run on a node, the kubelet adds a set of environment variables for each active Service. It supports both Docker links compatible variables and simpler `{SVCNAME}_SERVICE_HOST` and `{SVCNAME}_SERVICE_PORT` variables, where the Service name is upper-cased and dashes are converted to underscores.
+
Our service name is "`mysql-service`" and so `MYSQL_SERVICE_SERVICE_HOST` and `MYSQL_SERVICE_SERVICE_PORT` variables are available to other pods.

Kubernetes also allows services to be resolved using DNS configuration. Send a Pull Request for adding this functionality to the lab as explained in https://github.com/javaee-samples/docker-java/issues/62[#62].

#### Start WildFly Replication Controller

. Start WildFly replication controller:
+
[source, text]
----
./cluster/kubectl.sh create -f ../../attendees/kubernetes/app-wildfly-rc.yaml
replicationcontrollers/wildfly-rc
----
+
It uses the following configuration file:
+
[source, yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: ReplicationController
metadata:
  name: wildfly-rc
  labels:
    name: wildfly
    context: docker-k8s-lab
spec:

        image: arungupta/wildfly-mysql-javaee7:k8s
        ports:
        - containerPort: 8080
----
+
. Check the status of Pod inside Replication Controller:
+
[source, text]
----
./cluster/kubectl.sh get po
NAME               READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
mysql-pod          1/1       Running   0          1h
wildfly-rc-w2kk5   1/1       Running   0          6m
----
+
. Get IP address of the Pod:
+
[source, text]
----
./cluster/kubectl.sh get -o template po wildfly-rc-w2kk5 --template={{.status.podIP}}
10.246.1.23
----

#### Access the application

. Log in to minion and access the application:
+
[source, text]
----
vagrant ssh minion-1
Last login: Thu Jul 16 00:24:36 2015 from 10.0.2.2
[vagrant@kubernetes-minion-1 ~]$ curl http://10.246.1.23:8080/employees/resources/employees/

----

### Rescheduling Pods

Replication Controller ensures that specified number of pod "`replicas`" are running at any one time. If there are too many, the replication controller kills some pods. If there are too few, it starts more.

WildFly Replication Controller is already running with one Pod. Lets delete this Pod and see how a new Pod is automatically rescheduled.

. Find the Pod's name:
+
[source, text]
----
./cluster/kubectl.sh get po
NAME               READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
wildfly-rc-w2kk5   1/1       Running   0          6m
----
+
. Delete the Pod:
+
[source, text]
----
./cluster/kubectl.sh delete po wildfly-rc-w2kk5
pods/wildfly-rc-w2kk5
----
+
Status of the Pods can be seen in another shell:
+
[source, text]
----
./cluster/kubectl.sh get -w po
NAME               READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
wildfly-rc-w2kk5   1/1       Running   0          2m
NAME               READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
wildfly-rc-xz6wu   0/1       Pending   0         2s
wildfly-rc-xz6wu   0/1       Pending   0         2s
wildfly-rc-xz6wu   0/1       Pending   0         12s
wildfly-rc-xz6wu   0/1       Running   0         14s
wildfly-rc-xz6wu   1/1       Running   0         22s
----
+
Notice how Pod with name "`wildfly-rc-w2kk5`" was deleted and a new Pod with the name "`wildfly-rc-xz6wu`" was created.

### Scaling Pods

Replication Controller allows dynamic scaling up and down of Pods.

. Scale up the number of Pods:
+
[source, text]
----
./cluster/kubectl.sh scale --replicas=2 rc wildfly-rc
scaled
----
+
. Status of the Pods can be seen in another shell:
+
[source, text]
----
./cluster/kubectl.sh get -w po
NAME               READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
wildfly-rc-bgtkg   1/1       Running   0          3m
NAME               READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
wildfly-rc-bymu7   0/1       Pending   0          2s
wildfly-rc-bymu7   0/1       Pending   0         2s
wildfly-rc-bymu7   0/1       Pending   0         2s
wildfly-rc-bymu7   0/1       Running   0         3s
wildfly-rc-bymu7   1/1       Running   0         12s
----
+
Notice a new Pod with the name "`wildfly-rc-bymu7`" is created.
+
. Scale down the number of Pods:
+
[source, text]
----
./cluster/kubectl.sh scale --replicas=1 rc wildfly-rc
scaled
----
+
. Status of the Pods using `-w` is not shown correctly https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/kubernetes/issues/11338[#11338]. But status of the Pods can be seen correctly as:
+
[source, text]
----
./cluster/kubectl.sh get po
NAME               READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
wildfly-rc-bgtkg   1/1       Running   0          9m
----
+
Notice only one Pod is running now.

### Application Logs
