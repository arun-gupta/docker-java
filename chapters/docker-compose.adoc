## Multiple Containers Using Docker Compose

[quote, github.com/docker/compose]
Docker Compose is a tool for defining and running complex applications with Docker. With Compose, you define a multi-container application in a single file, then spin your application up in a single command which does everything that needs to be done to get it running.

An application using Docker containers will typically consist of multiple containers. With Docker Compose, there is no need to write shell scripts to start your containers. All the containers are defined in a configuration file using _services_, and then `docker-compose` script is used to start, stop, and restart the application and all the services in that application, and all the containers within that service. The complete list of commands is:

[options="header"]
|====
| Command | Purpose
| `build` | Build or rebuild services
| `help` | Get help on a command
| `kill` | Kill containers
| `logs` | View output from containers
| `port` | Print the public port for a port binding
| `ps` | List containers
| `pull` | Pulls service images
| `restart` | Restart services
| `rm` | Remove stopped containers
| `run` | Run a one-off command
| `scale` | Set number of containers for a service
| `start` | Start services
| `stop` | Stop services
| `up` | Create and start containers
| `migrate-to-labels  Recreate containers to add labels
|====

Docker Compose script is only available for OSX and Linux. https://github.com/arun-gupta/docker-java/issues/3 is used for tracking Docker Compose on Windows.

### Configuration File

. Entry point to Compose is `docker-compose.yml`. Lets use the following file:
+
[source, yml]
----
mysqldb:
  image: mysql
  environment:
    MYSQL_DATABASE: sample
    MYSQL_USER: mysql
    MYSQL_PASSWORD: mysql
    MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: supersecret
mywildfly:
  image: arungupta/wildfly-mysql-javaee7
  links:
    - mysqldb:db
  ports:
    - 8080:8080
----
+
This file is available in https://github.com/javaee-samples/docker-java/raw/master/attendees/docker-compose.yml[] and shows:
+
.. Two services defined by the name `mysqldb` and `mywildfly`
.. Image name for each service defined using `image`
.. Environment variables for the MySQL container are defined in `environment`
.. MySQL container is linked with WildFly container using `links`
.. Port forwarding is achieved using `ports`

### Start Services

. All services can be started, in detached mode, by giving the command:
+
  docker-compose up -d
+
And this shows the output as:
+
  Creating attendees_mysqldb_1...
  Creating attendees_mywildfly_1...
+
An alternate compose file name can be specified using `-f`.
+
An alternate directory where the compose file exists can be specified using `-p`.
+
. Started services can be verified as:
+
[source, text]
----
> docker-compose ps
        Name                       Command               State                Ports               
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
attendees_mysqldb_1     /entrypoint.sh mysqld            Up      3306/tcp                         
attendees_mywildfly_1   /opt/jboss/wildfly/customi ...   Up      0.0.0.0:8080->8080/tcp, 9990/tcp 
----
+
This provides a consolidated view of all the services started, and containers within them.
+
Alternatively, the containers in this application, and any additional containers running on this Docker host can be verified by using the usual `docker ps` command:
+
[source, text]

### Verify Application

. Access the application at http://dockerhost:8080/employees/resources/employees/. This is shown in the browser as:

.Output From Servers Run Using Docker Compose
image::images/docker-compose-output.png[]

### Stop Services

Stop the services as:

  docker-compose stop
  Stopping attendees_mywildfly_1...
  Stopping attendees_mysqldb_1...

[WARNING]
====
Stopping and starting the containers again will give the following error:

[source, text]
----
wildfly_1 | 
wildfly_1 | 09:11:07,802 ERROR [org.jboss.as.controller.management-operation] (management-handler-thread - 4) JBAS014613: Operation ("add") failed - address: ([
wildfly_1 |     ("subsystem" => "datasources"),
wildfly_1 |     ("jdbc-driver" => "mysql")
wildfly_1 | ]) - failure description: "JBAS014803: Duplicate resource [
wildfly_1 |     (\"subsystem\" => \"datasources\"),
wildfly_1 |     (\"jdbc-driver\" => \"mysql\")
wildfly_1 | ]"
----

This is expected because the JDBC resource is created during every run of the container. In a real-world application, this would be pre-baked in the configuration already.
====

### Remove Containers

Stop the services as:

  docker-compose rm -f
  Going to remove attendees_mywildfly_1, attendees_mysqldb_1
  Removing attendees_mywildfly_1... done
  Removing attendees_mysqldb_1... done
